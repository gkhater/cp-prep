# CP Drills Checklist (Newest entries first)
- [ ] Didn't properly account for all the edgecases
- [ ] Made my problem size linear, but took long to think about iterating through possible values — **think how what you proved simplifies**. 
- [ ] Forgot MOD while doing DP
- [ ] Arithmetic mistake
- [X] Bug due to messy impl (1st try)
- [X] Quick greedy #1500 NT (<30min)
- [X] Forgot to use `ll` when dealing with large numbers (e.g., `int` overflow in `diff = m - n`)
- [X] Handwaved an idea without checking edge cases or doing the math — **write things down**, it helps clarify logic!
