# CP Drills Checklist (Newest entries first)

- [ ] Bug due to messy impl (1st try)
- [X] Quick greedy #1500 NT (<30min)
- [ ] Forgot to use `ll` when dealing with large numbers (e.g., `int` overflow in `diff = m - n`)
- [X] Handwaved an idea without checking edge cases or doing the math â€” **write things down**, it helps clarify logic!
